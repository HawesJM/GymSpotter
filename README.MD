# Gym Spotter
### Introduction
Gym Spotter is a web application designed to aid the individual user to develop and maintain a desired exercise routine in order to set and achieve specific fitness aims and life goals. To do this it aims to help users assess their body type, set realistic fitness targets with this in mind, and plan accordingly with the most efficient strategy and techniques for them. Gym Spotter also aims to support the user by introducing the concept of a community of individuals with shared goals, as sharing their progress within a likeminded peer group of individuals with similar time constrains or struggles helps build accountability and maintain motivation. Gym Spotter also aims to underpin this heightened knowledge and sharpened motivation by providing users with a wealth of tips and external resources to find the best workout regime for them. In so doing Gym Spotter aims to be a focal point of a conscientious and content fitness and lifestyle minded community that firstly offers advice and resources tailored to the individual, and secondly never loses sight of the sense fun and camaraderie offered by sports and exercise that keeps people engaged and motivated in their workouts.

The concept was developed for the purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. It was built to express the knowledge and skills gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules.

The live website can be found here.

### Structure
##### Archetecture
Gym Spotter is built using pure HTML5 and CSS according to the principles of creating a responsive and accessible static front-end user-centric website. Bootstrap and media queries were also used to ensure responsive design.

##### User Experience Design
For fist time visitors I imagined the user first of all wanting to know the best way to get started working out in an appropriate way, and quickly access a starting framework for sustainable progress and remaining motivated. For returning users I wanted to begin developing a framework where they can continually assess their progress according to an easily defined roadmap and measure their achievements against certain external standards. In both cases I wanted clear and easily navigable content on desktop, tablet and also mobile device so users can effectively achieve their goals while working out or while taking some rest in their downtime.
##### Navigation
All Pages will contain a Navigation menu at the top of the Webpage that directs them to a new Page to easily allow users to Navigate the site easily. The Nav Menu will be collapsable on a Mobile device to make use of space on smaller devices. The homepage will give a brief introduction to the purpose of the site itself. "Plans and Goals" will provide users with the basic information to get started. "Contact and Social" will help users to stay on track through positive engagement and accountability. "External Resources" will provide paths for users to enhance and develop their workout plans and lifestyle according to the principles introduced in previous sections.

Across all devices and screen sizes the layout will remain clean and the flow of information will progress logically, enhanced at certain points by CTAs. All pages will contain a footer with social media contact links for further engagement. Certain elements on each page will respond interactively to help usersmove through the information flow of the site.
